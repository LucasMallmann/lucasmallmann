    "second": "I currently work as a Software Developer at Globo. I started programming in the year 2016, and my interest in the world of development is only increasing every day! I always try to learn and apply new technologies, which is one of the reasons why I built this blog, because I believe that the best way to learn is to teach.",
    "third": "I like music a lot, am passionate about games, an adventurer in cooking, and in my free time I love to philosophize about life. Despite being a technology-oriented blog, don't be surprised if we bring some reflections here.",
    "fourth": "Many dreams and goals of mine were born out of online resources I found about technology. I believe it's my duty, and I'll be extremely happy if I can repay you a little of that learning and what brought me here! #keepgoing."
